# 🌐 Remote Sensing Image Analysis Project 🌐
This project is designed to analyze remote sensing images using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive framework for image processing, feature extraction, and clustering analysis. This dataset consist of 7 classes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* Frontend: Jupyter Notebook
* Backend: Python
* AI Tools: TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, scikit-learn-extra
* Libraries: numpy, pandas, zipfile, os

## 📦 Installation
To install the required libraries, run the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn scikit-learn-extra tensorflow keras
```
### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8 or later
* Jupyter Notebook installed
* Required libraries installed

### Running locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the repository directory
3. Run `jupyter notebook` to start the Jupyter Notebook server
4. Open the `Remotesensing.ipynb` file to start the remote sensing image processing
5. Open the `clustering.ipynb` file to start the clustering analysis

## 💻 Usage
1. Run the `Remotesensing.ipynb` file to preprocess the remote sensing images
2. Run the `clustering.ipynb` file to perform clustering analysis on the preprocessed images
